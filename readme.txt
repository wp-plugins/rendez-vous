Rendez Vous is a BuddyPress plugin to schedule appointments with your buddies

== Description ==

This is a BuddyPress plugin to let your community members schedule appointments. Rendez-Vous is a french word.. But i think it has an approaching meaning in english ;)
It's a "doodle" like feature plugin where the organizer defines some dates and hours to meet, and the potential attendees will select the ones that match their agenda.
The organizer can then define the definitive date and once this date is past, he will also be able to add some notes or a report to inform about what happened during this meeting.

Available in french and english.

== Installation ==

Make sure Rendez Vous is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/rendez-vous/".

Activate Rendez Vous in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link. If you're using WordPress Multisite, make sure to activate Rendez Vous at the same level than BuddyPress: if BuddyPress is network activated, then network activate Rendez Vous, if BuddyPress is activated on a blog, then activate Rendez Vous on the same blog.
